no. absolutely not.\n\nit is the fault of the government who deliberately creates divides, like teaching irish white children in disadvantaged schools that they have white privilege. @newstalkfm don't highlight that, nor did they highlight a video that circulated of a well-known black entertainer filming a white irish man who he had paid to do push ups for his apparent amusement. a verbal insult is far more controversial it seems.\n\nthis lady's feelings were hurt, and it wasn't a nice experience but the comment was made to a woman who clearly isn't homeless and has enjoyed many benefits of living in an ireland that is for the most part not racist.\n\nshe also conveniently ignores the well-known fact that some amount of rough sleepers would, traditionally, have addiction problems and social issues. some live a dysfunctional life and a large proportion of those typically have a background of trauma, abuse, and a family with transgenerational addiction problems.\n\nthey are often born into situations where systemic societal issues are perpetuated by government after government. they have little access to the right mental health and addiction supports. the average age of death for a person in these circumstances is 42.\n\nthey are not privileged, no matter how some may like to spin it.""",,african woman claim irish homeless man white privilegennby suzie dnna woman afforded maximum privilege given national platform speak victim white privilege interaction man asked spare change irony word lost result sense entitlement instilled woke liberal establishment caterwauling unchallenged patkennynt newstalk happy push white privilege critical race agenda shoved hard neck wonder incident creatednnbut letu2019s happen course interview described refused money man absolute right response alleged told leave country arguably right free speechfor disagreennhe nice person rude genuinely racist aggressive beggar tailor insult say d imagine ve receiving end insult situation politely accept display displeasurennrecently homeless people approached friend fiver given friend happens member travelling community second later homeless woman approached looking money refused friend pleased expressed thatnnim pretty sure know group traveller background derogatory know making victim national radio got life understood pas verbal insult person situationnnthis condone behaviour understand human response desperation frustration verbal abuse likely personal scenario sonnif expecting person rough street dublin responsibility hurt feeling contributed clearly entitled possible calculated insult framing incident white privilege national radio calculated absurd believe intended effect public oppositennanyone sense understand homeless people feeling understandable resentment undeniably treated second class citizen fault woman absolutely notnnit fault government deliberately creates divide teaching irish white child disadvantaged school white privilege newstalkfm highlight highlight video circulated wellknown black entertainer filming white irish man paid push ups apparent amusement verbal insult far controversial seemsnnthis lady feeling hurt nice experience comment woman clearly homeless enjoyed benefit living ireland racistnnshe conveniently ignores wellknown fact rough sleeper traditionally addiction problem social issue live dysfunctional life large proportion typically background trauma abuse family transgenerational addiction problemsnnthey born situation systemic societal issue perpetuated government government little access right mental health addiction support average age death person circumstance 42nnthey privileged matter spin

rural independent group of tds, has made shocking revelations regarding what he believes to be systematic fraud within the land registry and the irish courts. these allegations, including perjury, misrepresentation, and a conspiracy to defraud irish citizens of their homes, farms, and properties, have come to light through a series of comprehensive documents prepared by edmund honohan, the master of the high court and addressed to all tds and senators. deputy mcgrath has himself reached out to all tds and senators, highlighting the serious issues at hand.\n \naddressing these concerns, deputy mcgrath stated from leinster house:\n \n\""this new documented evidence brings to light a far-reaching fraudulent scheme involving perjury, misrepresentation, and a conspiracy to defraud irish citizens of their homes, farms, and properties. honohan, a highly respected expert in this field, indicates that the courts are consistently deceived by the presentation of land registry folios with misleading mortgage ownership information, falsely presented as 'conclusive' evidence.\""\n \n\""the information revealed suggests that the entities known as 'credit servicers,' often referred to as vulture funds, may not actually possess ownership of the mortgages, despite being registered as such. this fraudulent practice raises significant concerns, affecting tens of thousands of distressed borrowers, including those with business properties, farms, and family homes.\""\n \n\""in light of these grave revelations, i have written to all fellow tds, urging them to share this documentation and to share it with their affected constituents, numbering in the tens of thousands. many of these individuals are entangled with vulture funds and face challenges within the judicial system. sharing this information is a means to empower affected citizens, especially those without legal representation, to assert their rights, which are protected under eu and irish law.\""\n \n\""in response to these concerning findings, i am calling on members of the oireachtas to unite across party lines and strongly urge the minister for justice and the minister for finance to promptly address the ongoing criminal acts.\""\n \n\""i am also demanding an immediate halt to this activity, pending a comprehensive investigation by various arms of the state, including the garda\u00ed, the corporate enforcement authority, the land registry, and the oireachtas joint committee on finance.\""\n \n\""i cannot emphasize the urgency of this situation enough, and i appeal to my colleagues in the

per 1,000. i won't have our bulk order until tuesday and i will phone you to arrange meeting you in your area and hand them to you. please let us have your delivery plan, which streets/estates, we need to keep a track so there is no wasted time or leaflets by covering the same area twice. considering get someone to help you (buddy safety system) or put a team together.\n\nplease avoid discussing your opinion of what is causing the excess deaths, any finger pointing at a possible cause will label the whole project as \""conspiracy theory\"" whereas it is actually \""conspiracy fact\"" and it will be up to an independent inquiry of experts (not politicians) to determine the cause(s).\n\ntips:-\u00a0\n\n1) you need to wear a glove on your right hand, letterbox lids can hurt your knuckles.\n\n2) we want to deliver these leaflets annomously to scare the politicians to death by not knowing exactly who is behind this public service initiative. so please wear clothes you don't normally wear plus sunglasses and a baseball cap.\n\n3) skip \""no junk mail\"" letterboxes (20 to 30%), we don't want to be accused of littering or hassment and you will cover more ground. also thier minds are closed and you will only waste leaflets and walks up driveways and may get into confrontations. these people may learn the news from their neighbours, friends or family who they will listen to. you should tuck a leaflet in the lid of those new locked anpost boxes as they never say \""no junk\""\n\n4) skip modern apartment buildings its hard to get to the letterboxes in the foyer, there is always a \""no junk\"" on the door and the residents are mostly young and will become aware of this initiative on socisl media anyway so it would be a waste of effort and leaflets. houses with a letterbox that do not say \""no junk\"" and have multiple doorbells should get the same number of leaflets as there are doorbells e.g. flats.\n\n5) depending on a number of factors it will take you 30 to 60 minutes to deliver 100 leaflets, 2 to 3 hours a day is enough for my old legs, you may only be up to 1 hour per day. figure this into your plan.\n\n6) when delivering in estates start on either left or right and keep following on that side, up and down side streets and you won't miss any houses and you will end up back where you started on the opposite side of the street. if two of you are doing the same estate (good for safety) one person should start on the left and the other on the right, as above and you will meet again in the middle when you have covered ever house.\n\n7) try to cover an entire estate or street and let us know with a good address or eircode in the middle of the estate / street when it's done so that we can cross it off our list. keep a notebook list of what you covered every session and send us a photo of your list each day so we can update the database and avoid duplications. send the photos of your lists daily to:- eireexcessdeaths@gmail.com. we

Ще одна ірландська різдвяна традиція - christmas eve ""big busk"" у центрі Дубліна.
Перш ніж говорити про цю традицію, давайте трохи пояснимо значення слова «busking». Це безкоштовний публічний виступ на вулиці, переважно музичний. Музикантів, які в ньому беруть участь, на жаргоні завсідників називають «buskers».
Зазвичай вони не мають офіційного дозволу на виступ але ірландська влада, як правило, допускає, якщо рівень звуку залишається прийнятним (можна грати з підсилювачами: уся справа в гучності). Треба сказати, що в ірландському суспільстві таке «шоу» дуже цінується!
А цього року, після трирічної перерви, повернеться і christmas eve big busk, даючи дублінцям можливість побачити, як деякі з найкращих музикантів країни співають різдвяні мелодії на допомогу simon community, організації, що допомогає бездомним. 
Серед попередніх виконавців на концерті були Боно, Глен Хансард, Хозьєр і Сінейд О'Коннор.","#UACTSHIVS
Another Irish Christmas tradition is Christmas Eve ""Big Busk"" in the center of Dublin.
Before talking about this tradition, let's explain the meaning of the word ""busking"" a little.This is a free public performance on the street, mostly music.The musicians who participate in it are called ""Buskers"" on the jargon.
Usually they do not have an official permission to perform, but the Irish authorities usually allow for the level of sound to be acceptable (you can play with amplifiers: the whole thing is in volume).I must say that in Irish society such a ""show"" is very appreciated!
And this year, after a three -year break, Christmas Eve Big Busk will return, giving the doubles the opportunity to see how some of the best musicians of the country sing Christmas tunes to help Simon Community, an organization that helps the homeless.
Among the previous performers at the concert were Bono, Glen Hansard, Hazier and Sineid O'Connor.",UACTSHIVS Irish Christmas tradition Christmas Eve Big Busk center Dublin talking tradition let explain meaning word busking littleThis free public performance street musicThe musician participate called Buskers jargon Usually official permission perform Irish authority usually allow level sound acceptable play amplifier thing volumeI Irish society appreciated year year break Christmas Eve Big Busk return giving double opportunity best musician country sing Christmas tune help Simon Community organization help homeless previous performer concert Bono Glen Hansard Hazier Sineid OConnor

Як раніше повідомлялося oileán, зміни передбачають надання державним житлом прибулим українцям максимум на 90 днів, якщо раніше воно надавалося без обмежень.

Відповідаючи на запитання, як українців вилучатимуть через 90 днів, О’Горман сказав, що коли інші країни-члени ЄС змінювали свої пропозиції, вони не бачили випадків, щоб українці відмовлялися брати участь у цьому процесі.

«Я вірю, що українці зможуть рухатися далі, чи це може бути переїзд до іншої країни-члена ЄС, це може бути перехід у приватний сектор тут», – сказав він.

According to Oileán, the Minister of Integration, Roderik O'Gorman, said that a change in place of placement for those who escalated from the war in Ukraine who has been provided with temporary protection will come into force since the end of January or early February.

As previously reported by Oileán, changes provide for the provision of public housing for a maximum of 90 days, if previously provided without restrictions.

Answering the questions of how Ukrainians would be removed in 90 days, O'Gorman said that when other EU member states changed their proposals, they did not see cases to refuse to participate in the process.

""I believe that Ukrainians will be able to move on whether it can be moving to another EU Member country, it can be a transition to the private sector here,"" he said.

Дисклеймер: у меня bank of ireland, какие условия у других банков мне не известно.

**Ставка стандарт/высокая стоимость**

**Стандартная ставка** — банк дает кэшбек после финализации, в моем случае это была бы 2% сумма от ипотеки (~€5,300). Люди на кэшбек обычно мебель покупают и все такое. Ставка в таком случае составляет 4.75%

** High Value Mortgage rate ** - for mortgages worth above 250k, but in this case there will be no cashback - is 3.95%

It is also possible to get a bet even lower if you have a house with a rating of energy efficiency B3 and better, but I have C3, so I don’t have this option.

После получения loan offer я могу подписать контракт. Но я хочу подписать его после того, как жильцы съедут и я более детально посмотрю все комнаты, когда они пустые. 

После подписания контракта моей стороной, вся пересылка денег и контрактов тудым-сюдым ещё 2-3 недели займет.

1 марта — примерно когда получу loan offer
7 марта — примерно когда подпишу контракт
27 марта — примерно когда закрою сделку и получу ключи

Current residents are evicted on March 6.

After receiving Loan Offer, I can sign a contract.But I want to sign it after the tenants have come and I will look at all the rooms in more detail when they are empty.

After signing the contract by my party, all the transfer of money and contracts to Tudym-Sydym will take another 2-3 weeks.

March 1 - approximately when I get Loan Offer
March 7 - approximately when I sign the contract

Багато європейських міст переживають кризу, пов'язану з нестачею квартир при населенні, що постійно зростає. Французька столиця не є винятком. І хоча це явище не нове, напруга на місцевому ринку оренди житла ще ніколи не була такою інтенсивною.

За даними агентства нерухомості lodgis, від початку пошуку однокімнатної мебльованої квартири в Парижі до заселення проходить в середньому 6 місяців, при цьому в третьому кварталі цього року ціни на орендоване житло зросли на 1%.

Таке обмежене зростання цін пояснюється тим, що з 2019 року в Парижі діють заходи щодо регулювання орендної плати. В інших великих французьких містах зростання було значно вищим: понад 10% у Бордо і майже 15% в Екс-ан-Провансі, за даними lodgis.

According to Lodgis real estate, from the beginning of the search for a one -bedroom furniture apartment in Paris before the settlement takes an average of 6 months, with the third quarter this year the prices for rental housing increased by 1%.

Such a limited increase in prices is explained by the fact that since 2019 in Paris there are measures to regulate the rent.In other major French cities, growth was much higher: more than 10% in Bordeaux and almost 15% in ex-An-Provens, according to Lodgis.

Дело в том что мой банк (ulster bank) уходит с ирландского рынка и закрывает все существующие счета в конце ноября. Поэтому в мае я решила что пришло время искать что-то другое. 

В Ирландии остаётся всего три банка (после ухода ulster bank и kbc): bank of ireland (boi), aib, permanent tsb (ptsb). Все три — различные сорта 💩

Плати. Оплатила бесконтактно? Плати. Оформила direct debit чтобы автоматически списывались деньги за коммуналку? Плати. В какой-то момент у меня набегало €9 в месяц в моем текущем банке.

Вчера очень хороший вопрос пришёл в чат, отвечаю!

Банки смотрят на то, как вы тратите деньги, на то, откладываете ли вы деньги, как справляетесь с ежемесячными платежами (например, по аренде), ну и смотрят на вашего работодателя.

- В среднем считается, что вы **должны быть на постоянном контракте** (permanent) а не на договоре подряда (contractor), однако если вы были на договоре подряда в течение трёх лет и есть доказательство, что дальше вам контракт продлят, то это тоже подходит 

- В среднем считается что вы **должны работать в течение года**, и как минимум закончить испытательный срок

- Если вы на штампе 1, банки могут отказаться рассматривать заявку. Так что эмпирически всё-таки стоит **дождаться штампа 4** и уже тогда подаваться на ипотеку. Однако и позитивных кейсов на штампе 1 тоже тьма!

Banks look at how you spend money, whether you are saving money, how you cope with monthly payments (for example, for rent), and look at your employer.

- On average, it is believed that you ** should be on a permanent contract ** (permanent) and not on the contract (Contractor), however, if you were on the contract for three years and there is evidence that the contract will extend further, thenThis is also suitable

- On average, it is believed that you ** should work during the year **, and at least finish the trial period

- If you are on stamp 1, banks may refuse to consider the application.So empirically, it is still worth ** to wait for the stamp 4 ** and even then supplied to the mortgage.However, positive cases on the stamp 1 is also darkness!

Найчастіше українців можна зустріти у Польщі, адже саме туди поїхала більша кількість наших людей.

По-перше, у нас з поляками трохи схожий менталітет, по-друге, поляки дуже допомагають українцям, і по-третє, через Польщу можна поїхати в будь-яку іншу країну.

Але існують й інші країни, які надають гарні умови та виплати.

Several million Ukrainians, with the beginning of a full -scale invasion, were forced to leave their homes and become actually refugees in foreign countries, who, fortunately, help to settle and live a normal life.

Most often, Ukrainians can be found in Poland, because it was there that more of our people went.

First, we have a little similar mentality with the Poles, secondly, the Poles help Ukrainians very much, and thirdly, through Poland you can go to any other country.

But there are other countries that provide good conditions and payments.

In Britain, it is not uncommon to meet Ukrainians.But it is not as easy to get there as to Poland.The fact is that Ukrainians have to find a British sponsor for living in the UK.And it should be understood that such sponsorship can end at any time, then the home will have to be rented on your own.

Це стає актуальним на фоні критичної нестачі місць для проживання в країні.

Раніше, особам під тимчасовим захистом дозволялося відсутність з державного житла до семи днів. Проте, новий протокол, введений 7 жовтня, звузив цю можливість, вимагаючи від них постійного перебування в призначеному місці проживання.

Це рішення було викликане тим, що кількість доступних місць для проживання не відповідає зростаючій потребі прибульців. Зокрема, на зимові місяці, департамент прагне забезпечити максимально ефективне використання наявних місць.

Однак, з огляду на святковий сезон, департамент висловив готовність розглянути винятки для тих, хто перебуває під тимчасовим захистом, що дозволить їм подорожувати на Різдво. Конкретні умови цих винятків будуть оприлюднені протягом наступних двох тижнів.

Earlier, persons under temporary protection were allowed from state housing for up to seven days.However, the new protocol introduced on October 7 has narrowed this opportunity, requiring them permanent stay at the appointed place of residence.

This decision was caused by the fact that the number of available places for living does not meet the growing need of aliens.In particular, for the winter months, the department seeks to ensure the most efficient use of available places.

However, given the holiday season, the Department expressed their readiness to consider exceptions for those who are temporary protection, which would allow them to travel for Christmas.The specific conditions of these exceptions will be made public within the next two weeks.

The Department reported that a contract for six weeks was concluded with Thomas Kosbi, owner of Stradball Hall.

The government is increasing concern about the status of Ireland ""alienated"" when it comes to the amount of social payments for Ukrainian refugees compared to other European countries.

Leo Varadar has hinted at the potential of changes in areas such as social security, in response to a recent parliamentary question of an independent MP Mark Maksharri.

 The latter asked if Taoiseach knew, ""that although we provide 38.80 euros a week for those looking for international protection, we are the full choice in the EU and neighboring countries with 220 euros a week for those who run from Ukraine.""

Конор Макгрегор, известный ирландский боец смешанных единоборств, рассказал о своих амбициях стать президентом Ирландии. Он указал на возрастные различия между собой и потенциальными конкурентами: Джерри (78 лет), Берти (75 лет) и Энда (74 года). 

В отличие от них, Макгрегор является молодым, активным и пылким кандидатом. Он подчеркнул о своей способности слушать и поддерживать людей, а также о готовности адаптироваться к новым вызовам. 

Макгрегор не состоит ни в одной партии и обещает быть ответственным перед народом Ирландии. Он также заявил о готовности финансировать свою политическую деятельность.

**Ирландцы критикуют Макгрегора за разжигание ненависти к мигрантам, в частности, его заявления в соцсетях могли привести к недавним беспорядкам в Дублине. Время покажет, сможет ли он перенести свой успех в спорте на политическую арену!

А что думаете вы по этом","** 👊 Conor McGregor: The power should be among the people of Ireland **

Conor McGregor, a famous Irish fighter of mixed martial arts, spoke about his ambitions to become president of Ireland.He pointed out age differences among themselves and potential competitors: Jerry (78 years old), Berty (75 years old) and End (74 years old).

In contrast, McGregor is a young, active and ardent candidate.He emphasized his ability to listen and support people, as well as his readiness to adapt to new challenges.

McGregor is not in any party and promises to be responsible to the people of Ireland.He also announced his readiness to finance his political activity.

2023-08-30 13:46:22+00:00,yetanotherjourney,"**📬 что такое __proof of address__**

дословно - подтверждение адреса (проживания)

оно необходимо практически везде, будь то получение irp, или регистрация в налоговой, или открытие счета в банке и т.д. я бы сказала, что это в какой-то степени аналог нашего ""адреса постоянной регистрации"" в России

что обычно принимается в качестве такого подтверждения:
🔸 договор аренды жилья
🔸 письмо от арендодателя с указанием того, что вы проживаете по такому-то адресу, начиная с такой-то даты
🔸 счет за жку на ваше имя (газ, электричество, интернет, обслуживание мусорных баков и т.д.)
🔸 почтовая корреспонденция/письмо от любого государственного органа, которое вы получили по данному адресу проживания

при переезде необходимо обязательно проинформировать все инстанции о смене адреса, чем я завтра и займусь, кстати, так как сегодня я забираю ключи от нового места жительства :)

#переезд #всякоеразное

[☘️ settle in dublin](https://t.me/yetanotherjourney)","** 📬 What is __proof of Address __ **

literally - confirmation of the address (residence)

It is necessary almost everywhere, whether it is IRP, or registration with the tax, or opening an account in a bank, etc.I would say that this is to some extent an analogue of our ""permanent registration address"" in Russia

which is usually accepted as such confirmation:
🔸 Housing lease agreement
🔸 A letter from the lessor indicating that you live at such an address, starting from such and such a date
🔸 Focus for housing and communal services to your name (gas, electricity, Internet, maintenance of garbage tanks, etc.)
🔸 Postal correspondence/letter from any state body that you received at this address of residence

When moving, it is imperative to inform all the authorities about changing the address than I will do tomorrow, by the way, since today I take the keys to the new place of residence :)

Вдруг из маминой из спальни,
Кривоногий и хромой,
Выбегает первый покупатель
И качает головой:

«Я тут контракт подписал, давайте всё-таки продолжим нашу сделку, я же вам на €3к больше предлагаю чем текущая покупательница»

Он ударил в медный таз
И вскричал «ВОЗЬМИ МЕНЯ!»

И сейчас же агенты
Затрещали, как трещотки:
«Ну Кристина вы же понимаете, прошлый покупатель закроет сделку за две недели, а вам пока банк одобрит пока то сё, а владелец хочет закрыться как можно скорее»

И самое обидное, что этот ебучий случай на 100% легален и блять некого винить, что я уже инженерный отчет получила, заплатила за него €570, потратила кучу времени чтобы посчитать, сколько мне нужно будет потратить на ремонт, представила в этом доме свою жизнь, разведала район, магазины рядом. 

Просто один звонок от агента — «Кристина у меня плохие новости». Эмпатии агента — ноль целых ноль десятых. 55 секунд звонок. «Пожалуйста, пришлите мне ваши банковские данные чтобы я мог вернуть депозит».","**And what happened?**

Suddenly from my mother’s bedroom
Crooked and lame,
The first buyer runs out
And shakes his head:

“I signed the contract here, let's still continue our deal, I offer you € 3k more than the current customer”

He hit the copper basin
And cried out ""Take me!""

And now the agents
We cracked like rattles:
“Well, Kristina, you understand, the last buyer will close the deal in two weeks, and so far the bank will approve you so far, and the owner wants to close as soon as possible”

And the most offensive is that this fucking case is 100% legal and fucking to blame that I already received an engineering report, paid € 570 for it, spent a lot of time to calculate how much I need to spend on repairs, introduced my life in this house, scouted the district, shops nearby.

Just one call from the agent - ""Kristina I have bad news.""Agent's empathy is zero zero zero tenths.55 seconds call.“Please send me your banking data so that I can return the deposit.”",happened Suddenly mother bedroom Crooked lame buyer run shake head signed contract let continue deal offer 3k current customer hit copper basin cried agent cracked rattle Kristina understand buyer close deal week far bank approve far owner want close soon possible offensive fucking case 100 legal fucking blame received engineering report paid 570 spent lot time calculate need spend repair introduced life house scouted district shop nearby agent Kristina bad newsAgents empathy zero zero zero tenths55 second callPlease send banking data return deposit

До этого много обсуждали почему сломан рынок аренды, тут вроде сомнений нет, цены улетели в космос и очереди на просмотр. Понятно, на просмотры домов на покупку тоже очереди (хотя может, не такие), а главное, аукционы! то есть не сильно легче. Но я даже про другое.

Есть такая штука как [mortgage measures](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/what-are-the-mortgage-measures). Штука на самом деле правильная и хорошая. Призвана минимизировать количество плохих долгов, банкротств и т.п. Думаю, в 2007 году её очень не хватало. Говорят, в ту пору Ирландию называли ""кельским тигром"". Весь западный мир (и Ирландия не исключение) был полон оптимизма - все думали, что экономика будет расти бесконечно, раздавали займы направо-налево без особых проверок и обеспечений. Результат мы все с вами знаем - Великая Рецессия. Эх, хорошее было время чтобы купить жильё. Конечно, с оговоркой - не для инвестиции, а чтобы жить ","And I wanted to tell why I think that the market for buying housing is ""broken"".Before that, they discussed a lot why the rental market is broken, there is no doubt here, prices flew into space and queue for viewing.It is clear that there are also queues for viewing houses for the purchase (although it may not be like that), and most importantly, auctions!That is, not much easier.But I'm even talking about something else.

There is such a thing as [Mortgage Measures] (https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explains/what-a-the-mortgage-measures).The thing is actually correct and good.It is designed to minimize the number of bad debts, bankruptcies, etc.I think that in 2007 she was very missing.They say that at that time Ireland was called the ""Kelsky tiger.""The whole Western world (and Ireland is not an exception) was full of optimism - everyone thought that the economy would grow endlessly, distributed loans to the right and left without special inspections and security.We all know the result - a great recession.Eh, there was a good time to buy housing.Of course, with a reservation - not for investment, but to live",wanted tell think market buying housing brokenBefore discussed lot rental market broken doubt price flew space queue viewingIt clear queue viewing house purchase importantly auctionsThat easierBut m talking thing Mortgage Measures httpswwwcentralbankieconsumerhubexplainswhatathemortgagemeasuresThe thing actually correct goodIt designed minimize number bad debt bankruptcy etcI think 2007 missingThey time Ireland called Kelsky tigerThe Western world Ireland exception optimism thought economy grow endlessly distributed loan right left special inspection securityWe know result great recessionEh good time buy housingOf course reservation investment live

Управління ООН у справах біженців висловило занепокоєння щодо подальшого використання наметів для шукачів притулку в Ірландії, оскільки погода стає холоднішою.

Понад 450 заявників на міжнародний захист живуть у трьох наметових місцях розміщення, розташованих у Дубліні, Клері та Вестміті.

Станом на 8 жовтня більшість, приблизно 319, проживали на території колишньої Центральної психіатричної лікарні в Дандрамі.

Наметове приміщення в columb barracks в Маллінгарі вміщує 56 осіб, які просили отримати міжнародний захист, тоді як намети поряд з центром прямого забезпечення в Нокалішіні в Міліку в Клері вміщують 76 шукачів притулку.

Місце, яке використовувалося для розміщення наметів для розміщення українських біженців у Страдбаллі в Ко-Лаоі, мало закритися завтра, але сьогодні ввечері Департамент інтеграції оголосив, що з наступного місяця це місце буде переведено на розміщення в опалювальних будиночках.","Concern by using tents for asylum seekers

🇮🇪🌐🇺🇦
The UN Refugee Office has been concerned about the further use of tents for asylum seekers in Ireland as the weather is getting colder.

More than 450 applicants for international protection live in three tent places located in Dublin, Clery and Westmiti.

As of October 8, most, approximately 319, lived in the territory of the former Central Psychiatric Hospital in Dandram.

The Kolumb Barrats tent room in Mellinggara contains 56 people who asked to receive international protection, while the tents, along with the Nokalishini Direct Support Center in the clek in Claire, contain 76 shelter seekers.

Повторно звертаємось з інформацією, що в Ірландії продовжується криза з наданням житла тимчасово переміщеним особам, які знаходяться під тимчасовим захистом в країні.

З лютого 2022 року з України до Ірландії переїхало близько 91 тисячі тимчасово переміщених громадян України, з них майже 70 тисяч звернулися за безкоштовним житлом від Уряду Ірландії.

У літні місяці кількість прибулих з України зросла, певну частину людей розміщали у студентських житлових приміщеннях, які вони мають звільнити найближчі декілька тижнів.

Через цей значний дефіцит очікується, що з наступного тижня для новоприбулих українців будуть використовувати намети/тенти, у тому числі для тих, хто проживав останні місяці у студентських гуртожитках.

Уряд Ірландії терміново працює над пошуком додаткового житла. 

Просимо врахувати та поставитись відповідально.","Dear citizens of Ukraine!

We re -address the information that in Ireland the crisis is continuing with the provision of housing to temporarily displaced persons under temporary protection in the country.

Since February 2022, about 91 thousand temporarily displaced citizens of Ukraine moved from Ukraine to Ireland, of which almost 70,000 have applied for free housing from the Ireland Government.

In the summer months, the number of arrivals from Ukraine increased, some of the people were placed in student living quarters, which they should be released for the next few weeks.

Because of this significant shortage, it is expected that tents/awnings will be used for newly arrived Ukrainians, including those who have lived in student hostels for the last months.

The Ireland Government is urgently working to find additional housing.

Этот шаг направлен на «нормализацию» депортаций и является одним из ряда репрессий против иммиграции, объявленных правительством. Правительство должно начать выполнять регулярные чартерные рейсы, предназначенные для депортации людей, которым не удалось подать заявление о предоставлении убежища.

Ожидается, что первые полеты на частных самолетах, нанятых Министерством юстиции, состоятся позднее в этом году.

Этот шаг происходит на фоне попыток правительства создать более жесткую картину иммиграции в преддверии местных и европейских выборов в июне. Иммиграция возглавляет список вопросов, привлекших внимание избирателей в прошлом месяце, согласно данным отслеживания общественных настроений, проведенного ipsos b&a.

🇮🇪
Уряд «вичерпав» усі варіанти пошуку житла для шукачів притулку, включаючи використання кораблів.

Чиновники Департаменту з питань інтеграції намагаються знайти найкращий спосіб підтримати заявників на міжнародний захист, яким ніде спати через брак ліжок.

Міністр фінансів Майкл Макграт сказав, що міністр інтеграції Родерік О'Горман чітко дав зрозуміти Кабінету, що «ми перебуваємо в дуже серйозній ситуації і потенційно через кілька днів можемо залишитися без варіантів розміщення».

Зрозуміло, що чиновники розглядали можливість використання громадських центрів, залів і кораблів у своїх зусиллях знайти більше притулку.

Officials of the Integration Department are trying to find the best way to support applicants for international protection that there is nowhere to sleep due to lack of beds.

Finance Minister Michael McGrata said that the Minister of Integration Roderik O'Gorman made it clear that ""we are in a very serious situation and potentially can stay in a few days without accommodation.""

It is clear that officials considered the use of public centers, halls and ships in their efforts to find more asylum.

🇮🇪💶🇺🇦
Передбачається кардинальний перегляд загальноукраїнської системи реагування на біженців із значними змінами в таких сферах, як соціальний захист, освіта та житло.

Ідея скорочення раніше була відкладена на полицю. На запитання цього тижня, чому уряд переглядає цю пропозицію, високопоставлені джерела сказали, що 30% українців, які прибувають до Ірландії, прибувають з інших європейських країн. 

У результаті уряд «зважує скорочення соціального забезпечення».

Це сталося після того, як учора Майкл Мартін заявив, що зараз існує «феномен», коли люди з України прибувають до Ірландії, перебуваючи в інших країнах ЄС. Він сказав, що такі дії чинять тиск на варіанти розміщення. Він сказав, що це те, що потрібно дослідити та чітко визначити кількісно.

As a result, the government ""weighs the reduction of social security"".

It happened after Michael Martin said yesterday that there is now a ""phenomenon"" when people from Ukraine come to Ireland while in other EU countries.He said that such actions put pressure on placement options.He said it was what to investigate and clearly define quantitatively.

С одной стороны (опять немного конспирологии) может показаться, и это вполне оправданно, что правительством управляют лобби инвестиционных фондов и крупных лендлордов. И они ""заказывают музыку"". Они заинтересованы, чтобы цены росли, чтобы аренда стоила дорого. Не просто дорого в абсолютных цифрах, но и в процентах от дохода домохозяйства - чтобы у людей и мыслей не было что-то там купить, превратить их в ""дойные коровы"".

On the one hand (again a little conspiracyology) it may seem, and this is quite justified that the government runs the lobby of investment funds and large landlords.And they ""order music.""They are interested in the prices to grow, so that the rental is expensive.Not only expensive in absolute numbers, but also as a percentage of the income of the household - so that people and thoughts do not have something to buy there, turn them into ""doctors"".

Многие говорят, мол, в девятнадцатом веке до голодомора тут жило сильно больше людей, чем сегодня (и сегодня только только приближаются к тем рекордам). И до меня не сразу дошло, что страна другая была, в смысле, никакой отдельной северной Ирландии не было. Как они считали? 🤷‍♂ Ну да ладно, может, это тоже как-то учли.

Ещё больше ста шестидесяти тысяч домов ""пустые"". Это при жилищном кризисе и рекордных ценах на жильё... Возможно, не все эти дома пригодны для жизни по современным стандартам, но тем не менее... Как минимум земля свободная, значит, есть. 🤔

Many say, they say, in the nineteenth century before the Holodomor there lived much more people than today (and today they are only approaching those records).And it did not immediately reach me that the country was, in the sense, there was no separate Northern Ireland.How did they think?🤷‍♂ Well, okay, maybe this was also taken into account.

Even more than one hundred and sixty thousand houses are ""empty"".This is with housing crisis and record prices for housing ... Perhaps not all these houses are suitable for life according to modern standards, but nevertheless ... at least the land is free, then there is.🤔

Біженців з України з наступного місяця розміщуватимуть у центрі заходів punchestown у Кілдері.

Це останній центр, який буде охоронятися на тлі постійного тиску з пошуку житла для прибулих біженців.

Але це сталося після того, як міністр Родерік О'Горман також підтвердив, що уряд не буде продовжувати контракт для біженців на проживання в наметах на місці electric picnic у Страдбаллі.

З наступного місяця у закладі буде надано 378 ліжок для людей, які тікають від війни в Україні, підтвердив речник Департаменту у справах дітей, рівності, інвалідів, інтеграції та молоді.

У центрі подій буде 78 контейнерів, які складатимуться з двох спалень, у кожній з яких розміщуватиметься максимум три людини, а також невелика вітальня.

But this happened after Minister Roderik O'Gorman also confirmed that the government would not continue the refugee contract for tents at the Electric Picnic in Stradball.

From next month, the institution will provide 378 beds for people who flee from the war in Ukraine, confirmed by a spokesman for the Department of Children, Equality, Disabled, Integration and Youth.

There will be 78 containers in the center of events, which will consist of two bedrooms, each with a maximum of three people, as well as a small living room.

The bathrooms are in a common space with individual booths.

Именно такой мы арендуем) 
Одна из проблем у нас в том, что кухня как бы, пристроена к дому. И она капец холодная. Хоть топи, хоть не топи. Тепло не держится. Хватает только если я пеку что-то долго в печке, на полчаса комфортного нахождения за ужином. Все решается тем, что закрываем на кухню дверь и иногда кушаем в гостиной. 
Но есть еще один нюанс, который я проглядела, так как весь подоконник у меня был заставлен цветами. 
Обычно, с наступлением темноты, мы опускаем ролл штору, так как окна находятся на уровне окон соседа (он, к слову, делает так же).  И всю ночь оно закрыто, а поднимаем утром. Сегодня я подняла штору и увидела, что окошко то у меня ревет крокодильими слезами. 
В подоконнике даже сделан специальный желоб, по которому через отверстия вода должна вытекать на улицу, но в итоге вода была на подоконнике, а не в желобе 😅

But there is another nuance that I looked at, since the whole windowsill was forced by flowers.
Usually, with the onset of darkness, we lower Roll the curtain, since the windows are at the level of the neighbor’s windows (he, by the way, does the same).And all night it is closed, and we raise it in the morning.Today I raised the curtain and saw that the window was roaring with crocodile tears.
A special groove is even made in the windowsill, according to which water should flow through the openings to the street, but in the end the water was on the windowsill, and not in the gutter 😅

Когда изучал, так сказать ""мнения людей из интернетов"" или из СМИ, тут могу ошибиться, наткнулся на ещё один интересный казус. Не из первых рук информация, не могу подтвердить, но звучит, в общем, правдоподобно.

Можно годами или десятилетими снимать квартиру в Дублине. Платить, соответственно, по €2,000 или более ежемесячно. Стабильно. Без просрочек, без форс-мажоров. С ежегодной индексацией (то есть повышением то ли на 4% в год по старой схеме, то ли на 1-2% по уже новой).

И это, чёрт возьми, не будет являться доказательством того, что вы можете быть надёжным заёмщиком для банка. Причём сумма ежемесячного платежа по займу на аналогичный дом, как правило, ниже, то есть это может быть и примерно  €1,000-€1,500.

When I studied, so to speak, the “opinions of people from the Internet” or from the media, here I can make a mistake, came across another interesting incident.Not out of first hand, I can not confirm, but it sounds, in general, believable.

You can rent an apartment in Dublin for years or decades.Pay, respectively, € 2.000 or more monthly.Stable.Without delays, without force majeure.With annual indexation (that is, an increase by 4% per year according to the old scheme, or by 1-2% by a new one).

And this, damn it, will not be proof that you can be a reliable borrower for the bank.Moreover, the amount of the monthly payment for a loan for a similar house is usually lower, that is, it can be approximately € 1.000- € 1.500.

Разумеется, волшебного рецепта у меня нет, хотя за три с лишним года и вот уже с третьей квартирой какое-никакое понимание о том, что важно, а что нет, есть. К сожалению, хотя и тогда мы были под впечатлением, что за жесть творится на рынке недвижимости, стало только хуже...

В общем, прихожу я смотреть очередную (спойлер: последнюю) квартиру, никого не трогаю. Пока жду своей очереди, агентша о чём-то разговаривает, видимо, с предыдущими кандидатами. Я конечно же не подслушивал, просто стоял рядом (и не затыкал уши).

Так вот, пара (наших возможных конкурентов) из США, мужчина и женщина (возможно, этнические ирландцы, но может и нет, это не важно, белые), постарше нас. Не знаю, с детьми или без (в принципе), но ""с собой не взяли"" (мы брали, кстати, хотя формально действует запрет с собой брать младше 16 из-за вируса, по факту на это забивают, без препятствий ходили на просмотр с детской коляской).

Одна фраза заставила меня занервничат","I promised you a life hack ""how to rent housing.""

Of course, I don’t have a magical recipe, although for more than three years and now with the third apartment there is a kind of understanding of what is important and what is not.Unfortunately, although then we were impressed what kind of tin was going on in the real estate market, it only became worse ...

In general, I come to watch the next (spoiler: the last) apartment, I do not touch anyone.While waiting for my turn, the agent is talking about something, apparently with previous candidates.Of course, I did not eavesdrop, just stood nearby (and did not plug my ears).

So, a couple (our possible competitors) from the USA, a man and a woman (possibly ethnic Irish, but maybe not, it doesn’t matter, white), older than us.I don’t know, with or without children (in principle), but they didn’t take it with us (we took, by the way, although it is formally acted by the ban with us to take it under 16 because of the virus, in fact they score it, we went without obstacles to viewwith a baby carriage).

Иммиграционный вопрос вызывает огромные разногласия и является большой проблемой как для правительства, так и для оппозиции.

Правительство пытается найти баланс: премьер-министр Лео Варадкар пообещал принять суровые меры против нелегальной иммиграции.

Г-н Варадкар сказал, что они нацелены на людей, которые пытаются «злоупотребить щедростью» ирландской системы.

Однако министры обязались заняться тревожной тенденцией поджогов зданий, предназначенных для просителей убежища.

Последний случай произошел в сгоревшем пустующем доме в графстве Килдэр.

Министр юстиции Хелен Макэнти заявила, что виновные будут привлечены к ответственности, в то время как она заявила, что протестующие против беженцев ""точно знают"", кто стоит за чередой поджогов. Шинн Фейн ранее занимала проиммиграционную позицию. Ранее партия призывала предоставить всем беженцам ту же поддержку, которую предоставили украинцам после российского вторжения, до того, как их недавно сократили.","Immigration
The immigration question causes huge disagreements and is a big problem for both the government and the opposition.

The government is trying to find a balance: Prime Minister Leo Varakar promised to take severe measures against illegal immigration.

Mr. Varakar said that they are aimed at people who are trying to “abuse the generosity” of the Irish system.

However, ministers pledged to take up an alarming trend in buildings intended for asylum suppliers.

The last incident occurred in a burned empty house in the county of Kilder.

The Minister of Justice Helen McAnty said that the perpetrators will be held accountable, while she stated that the protesters against refugees ""know for sure"" who was behind a series of arson.Shinn Fayne previously took a mortgage position.Earlier, the party called for all refugees to provide the same support that Ukrainians were provided after Russian invasion, before they were recently reduced.",Immigration immigration question cause huge disagreement big problem government opposition government trying find balance Prime Minister Leo Varakar promised severe measure illegal immigration Mr Varakar aimed people trying abuse generosity Irish system minister pledged alarming trend building intended asylum supplier incident occurred burned house county Kilder Minister Justice Helen McAnty perpetrator held accountable stated protester refugee know sure series arsonShinn Fayne previously took mortgage positionEarlier party called refugee provide support Ukrainians provided Russian invasion recently reduced

Разумеется, нет, бежать к своему лендлорду и просить ""сделать скидку"" увы, рановато. Не поймёт.

Речь не о номинальной цене, а о реальной. Мол, из-за нового закона (теперь вместо 4% будет индекс инфляции потолком) не смогут быстро повышать, а зато зарплаты будут расти быстрее инфляции, и КАК ЗАЖИВЁМ.

Щойно прибулим до Ірландії українцям може бути запропоновано державне житло лише на три місяці, перш ніж їм доведеться шукати власне житло.

Департамент taoiseach і Департамент інтеграції працюють над новою політикою для тих, хто тікає від війни, з меморандумом, який незабаром буде поданий до Кабінету міністрів.

Важливою зміною в урядовій політиці стане те, що українцям доведеться або шукати житло в приватному секторі оренди, або брати нерухомість під заставу за схемою «пропозиція житла» після трьох місяців перебування в державному житлі.

Офіційні особи працюють над тим, коли набудуть чинності зміни. Вони стосуватимуться лише новоприбулих до країни .

Джерело в уряді повідомило, що обмеження часу на розміщення було зроблено для того, щоб привести пропозиції Ірландії у відповідність до інших країн ЄС.

An important change in government policy will be that Ukrainians will either have to look for housing in the private lease, or take real estate on bail under the scheme of ""Housing"" after three months of staying in public housing.

Officials are working on when the change will come into force.They will only relate to the newcomers to the country.

Історія розповідає про ельфів, які щодня відвідують дітей між Днем Подяки та Святвечором. Їх посилає Санта Клаус перевірити, чи діти слухняні, і доповісти начальнику про свої висновки. Так в оселях почали з’являтися іграшкові ельфи, які “слідкують” за дітьми.
Головне правило: дітям заборонено торкатися іграшки – вони можуть лише розмовляти з нею та розповідати різдвяні побажання.
Щоранку ельф опиняється в новому місці в домі, де його можуть знайти діти.

- Також було ініційовано відбір вільних будинків, який вестиме місцева влада.
- Було запроваджено політику відмов, тобто людям, які відмовляються від пропозиції відповідного житла один раз, не буде запропоновано інший варіант.
- Зрозуміло, що ці зміни є спробою забезпечити біженцям переїзд із готелів, до більш постійного житла.

Ее исполнительный директор Джон Коулман сообщит Комитету по жилищному строительству oireachtas, что к концу 2028 года планируется прямая сдача 6000 домов.

Г-н Коулман ожидает, что в 2024 году у lda будет восемь объектов, находящихся под прямым контролем. Еще 8000 домов могут быть сданы по схеме project tosaigh к концу 2028 года.

Its executive director John Coleman will inform the Oireachtas housing construction committee that by the end of 2028, a direct delivery of 6,000 houses is planned.

За межами Дубліна ціни зросли на 4% за останній рік, тоді як ціни в Дубліні спостерігали тримісячну тенденцію до зниження, впавши на 1,9% станом на вересень згідно з індексом цін на житлову нерухомість.

Тревор Грант, голова консультантів з іпотечного кредитування Ірландії, попередив уряд, що ціна «може почати різко зростати», якщо цільові показники пропозиції штату не будуть досягнуті, оскільки спостерігається «підвищений рівень активності на іпотечному ринку».

Грант пояснює це збільшення підвищеною активністю та припускає, що схеми в рамках стратегії «Житло для всіх» призвели до збільшення попиту.

Outside Dublin, prices have increased by 4% in the last year, while prices in Dublin have observed a three -month trend to a decrease, falling by 1.9% as of September according to the index of residential real estate prices.

Trevor Grant, the chairman of the Ireland mortgage consultants, warned the government that the price ""can start growing dramatically"" if the target indicators of the state supply are not achieved, as there is an ""increased level of activity in the mortgage market"".

The grant explains this increase in increased activity and suggests that the schemes within the ""Housing Strategy for All"" have led to an increase in demand.

Despite the rise in prices and the risk of its continuation, the grant says that it is still cheaper than renting for a long period.

Как можно [это,](https://www.daft.ie/for-sale/detached-house-feltham-glenbane-askeaton-co-limerick/5558057) или [это,](https://www.daft.ie/for-sale/detached-house-ballylahiff-oola-co-limerick/5553312) или вот [это](https://www.daft.ie/for-sale/detached-house-shanid-lower-shanagolden-co-limerick/5538168) выставлять на продажу как ДОМ?!

Очевидно это скорее site — участок, на котором еще есть какие-то останки здания в прошлом. Но никак не ДОМ.

Как минимум, на такое тебе не дадут ипотеку. Чтобы банк дал ипотеку, дом должен быть в живучем состоянии — водопровод, кухня, спальня. Да, в нем может быть нужно делать серьезный ремонт, но если в доме нет даже кухни, его можно купить только на наличку.

Реально плевок какой-то, дом с тремя спальнями, но с дырками в крыше…

Ранее действовало ограничение для ""перворазников"" (first time buyer) - максимум, на который они могли рассчитывать - x3.5 от годового дохода. То есть при зарплате в 100 тысяч максимум положен в 350. Банки иногда давали в порядке исключения больше, но количество ""исключений"" строго ограничено.

Ослабили до x4.... Я бы сказал, недостаточно. Но всё равно шаг в правильном направлении.

Кстати, даже если я, например, буду умолять банк, чтобы он мне предоставил исключение и дал, например, x4.5, немного увеличивается вероятность того, что у меня получится это сделать - так как многим, кому не хватало, например, x3.5, вполне хватит x4, я с ними не буду конкурировать. В теории.

So, although the bank really closed all the iron blinds at 16:00, all the clients who were sipped in line until 15:59 inclusive were carefully served without a single hint of “what the hell are you forcing people to linger at work”

Moreover, in front of me ten times apologized for making me wait!

I left the bank at 16:30 and there were still customers.Another polite girl opened a spare door and wished a good weekend.

Я уже была на таком год назад, узнала много нового. В этот раз узнала меньше нового 🤣 но всё-таки что-то узнала и расскажу вам.

В Ирландии всего восемь компаний, которые могут дать вам ипотеку, из них три — это банки (aib, ptsb, boi, ebs) и кредитные учреждения (avant money, finance ireland, haven, ics mortgages).

И некоторые из них не работают с физиками, а только с брокерами! Вот это для меня новость была, если честно. Поэтому получается, что брокеры (посредники между тобой и учреждением) удобны как ни крути — платить им будешь не ты, а банк, они за тебя всё происследуют, а ты спокойно выберешь, и плюс им открыты какие-то варианты, которые не открыты тебе.

In Ireland, there are only eight companies that can give you a mortgage, of which three are banks (AIB, PTSB, BOI, EBS) and credit institutions (Avant Money, Finance Ireland, Haven, ICS Mortgages).

And some of them do not work with physicists, but only with brokers!This was the news for me, to be honest.Therefore, it turns out that brokers (intermediaries between you and the institution) are convenient as it may seem-you will not pay them, but a bank, they will be able to choose everything for you, and you will calmly choose, and plus some options that are not open to you..

Вы тоже это слышите?

Откуда-то из анналов вашей памяти вдруг всплывает слоган «просто добавь воды»? 

Пропели?

В общем, да, майвади что-то типа юпи и инвайта, тока не в порошке, а в таком вот концентрированном жидком виде. На первый вкус — химоза. На второй все ещё химоза 🤪 а на третий ты наливаешь напиток в большой кувшин, ставишь в холодильник и радуешься, что тебе есть чем охладиться в течение дня.

Согласно сайту, в майвади содержатся витамины и нет сахара 🤷🏻‍♀️

Miwadi is an Irish brand of a fruit drink that must be diluted with water.

Do you hear that too?

From somewhere in the annals of your memory, the slogan “just add water” suddenly pops up?

Have you sung?

In general, yes, Maivadi is something like Jupy and invite, current is not in powder, but in such a concentrated liquid form.For the first taste - chemosis.The second is still chemose 🤪 And on the third you pour a drink into a large jug, put in the refrigerator and rejoice that you have something to cool throughout the day.

According to the site, the Mayvadi contains vitamins and there is no sugar 🤷🏻‍♀️

I still screamed at the first time with the name-Miwadi (“mine” Vadi), this is even [in the same advertising] (https://yutu.be/d4d-qjcsgha) the product beat that it ’not your wadi, it’s my wadi.And in Scotland, vodka affectionately called Voddy (Woddy).In general, these paronyms do not give me peace, I giggle.

Конечно, смешанные впечатления.

Во-первых, организует их довольно маргинальная левопопулистская партия. Которая иногда в прямом смысле выступает ""за всё плохое против всего хорошего"". Например, те ребята считают, что Ирландия ""недостаточно нейтральная"".

Ну и требования их интересны - контроль цен на энергоносители и еду (привет, дефицит! очереди, бензин и еда по карточкам!), повышения зарплат всем (щедро!), заморозка и понижение арендных платежей (вроде звучит привлекательно, да вот только дома кто построит?).

Конечно, в чём-то они ругают правящую коалицию за дело. Жилищный кризис - то, что нельзя свалить никак на действующие обстоятельства (такие как пандемия, специальная военная опера","We had protests the day before yesterday ... [against high prices.

Of course, mixed impressions.

Firstly, they are organized by a rather marginal levopopulistic party.Which sometimes literally stands ""for everything bad against all the best.""For example, those guys believe that Ireland is ""not neutral enough.""

Well, their requirements are interesting - control of energy prices and food (hello, deficit! Queues, gasoline and food on cards!), Raising salaries to everyone (generously!), Freezing and lowering rental payments (it seems to be attractive, but only at home who is at homebuild?).

Of course, in some way they scold the ruling coalition for business.Housing crisis is that it cannot be dumped in any way on the current circumstances (such as pandemia, a special military opera",protest day yesterday high price httpswwwpbpiejointhelocaloproTeststsoverthecostoflisingonnovember1 12th mass begin judge large city IrelandIn different area Dublin course mixed impression Firstly organized marginal levopopulistic partyWhich literally stand bad bestFor example guy believe Ireland neutral requirement interesting control energy price food hello deficit Queues gasoline food card Raising salary generously Freezing lowering rental payment attractive home homebuild course way scold ruling coalition businessHousing crisis dumped way current circumstance pandemia special military opera

Тем не менее, рост цен делает этот аттракцион невиданной щедрости ненастолько уж привлекательным.

В октябре заканчивается двенадцатимесячный контракт за электричество. Хотя вроде бы это и длительный контракт, цена там была всё равно ""плавающая"".

🇮🇪🇺🇦
Основні моменти вчорашнього виступу міністрів.

«Ми хочемо дати їм реалістичний смак Ірландії, — заявив Родерік О'Горман, — «Залишаючи найбільш уразливих людей гнити в стихії для благодійних організацій, дозволяючи цьому уряду продовжувати провалюватися у більш важливих сферах, таких як охорона здоров’я, житло та поліція».

Висловлюючи занепокоєння щодо додаткового навантаження на свій департамент, міністр житлово-комунального господарства Дарра О'Брайен сказав, що він уже «закидався настільки, наскільки це можливо на даний момент».

«Ми вже відстаємо на два десятиліття з житлом, а тепер ви хочете, щоб я розмістив ще більше людей?» кинув виклик О'Браєн, «Мене покинули. Господи, коли наступна перестановка? Я справді сподіваюся, що Шинн Фейн прийде до влади, щоб ми могли просто спостерігати за їхнім вибухом».

«Можливо, нам варто просто найняти більше радників, щоб лукаво натякнути громадськості, що Ірландія заповнена», — поділився один ","We want to give them a realistic taste of Ireland

🇮🇪🇺🇦
The main points of yesterday's speech of ministers.

""We want to give them a realistic taste of Ireland,"" said Roderik O'Gorman, ""leaving the most vulnerable people in the element for charitable organizations, allowing the government to continue to fall in more important areas such as health, housing and police"".

By expressing concern about the additional burden on his department, the Minister of Housing and Communal Services Darr O'Brien said that he had already ""thrown as much as possible at the moment.""

""We are already behind two decades with housing, and now you want me to place even more people?""O'branin challenged, “I was left.Lord, when is the next permutation?I really hope that Shinn Fein will come to power so we can simply watch their explosion. ""

""Maybe we should just hire more advisers to hint the public that Ireland is filled,"" one shared",want realistic taste Ireland main point yesterday speech minister want realistic taste Ireland Roderik OGorman leaving vulnerable people element charitable organization allowing government continue fall important area health housing police expressing concern additional burden department Minister Housing Communal Services Darr OBrien thrown possible moment decade housing want place peopleObranin challenged leftLord permutationI hope Shinn Fein come power simply watch explosion Maybe hire adviser hint public Ireland filled shared

Не скажу, что за 30 минут можно много нового полезного узнать. Но какие-то вопросы я подготовил... жаль не на все смог получить ответ, увы. 😁 Впрочем, разберусь сам, как и всегда до этого.

Вообще сложилось впечатление, что не пыльная работа весьма у финансового консультанта. Ответственности никакой - я думаю, эти ребята вам в любом случае не советуют ""покупай вот эту компанию на все деньги"" или ""срочно продавай все евро и покупай доллары"" или что-то такое. Они всегда дают аккуратные советы и всегда расплывчато. За всё хорошее, против всего плохого. Будут советовать диверсифицировать портфель (любимое слово наверное), помогут разобраться в базовых вещах, что такое финансовый инструмент, для чего он нужен и т.п. Ну и психологические вопросы, как в принципе начать откладывать, сколько нужно откладывать, как подсчитать размер своей цели (покупка жилья/пенсия и т.п.). В общем, чело","Yesterday I talked (for the first time in my life actually! Although it is just so important) with a financial consultant ... I will not say that in 30 minutes you can learn a lot of useful things.But I prepared some questions ... It’s a pity that I could not get an answer, alas.😁 However, I will figure it out myself, as always before.

In general, the impression was that not a dusty work is very for a financial consultant.There is no responsibility - I think these guys in any case do not advise you “buy this company for all the money” or “Urgently sell all the euros and buy dollars” or something like that.They always give neat advice and always vaguely.For everything good, against everything bad.They will advise to diversify the portfolio (their favorite word is probably), they will help to understand the basic things, what a financial instrument is, why it is needed, etc.Well, psychological issues, how to start postponing, in principle, how much you need to postpone, how to calculate the size of your goal (buying housing/pension, etc.).In general, a person",Yesterday talked time life actually important financial consultant 30 minute learn lot useful thingsBut prepared question pity answer ala figure general impression dusty work financial consultantThere responsibility think guy case advise buy company money Urgently sell euro buy dollar thatThey neat advice vaguelyFor good badThey advise diversify portfolio favorite word probably help understand basic thing financial instrument needed etcWell psychological issue start postponing principle need postpone calculate size goal buying housingpension etcIn general person

Этот называется mid career - думал, буду чуть более конкретные советы о том, как сохранить накопления и ускорить их рост... Но нет, были всё также расплывчато обтекаемо то, что для многих давно очевидно. В Ирландии очень популярна тема всяких фондов с драконовской комиссией (или ""на входе"" или ежегодно на всю сумму фонда или то, и другое). Часто их предлагают, например, банки или страховые компании. А индивидуальные инвесторы встречаются реже - особенно среди тех, кто не ворочает миллионами.

2021-03-05 08:33:00+00:00,emerald_isle,"Вы, возможно, слышали (в том числе и от меня) о том, что в период пандемии спрос на жильё (во всяком случае съёмное) немножко упал. Совсем незначительно. Цены на него не упали практически никак. С редкими может быть исключениями. А кое-где и подросли. С покупкой другая история, там, думаю, и близко падения не было, так как у покупающих другой горизонт планирования.

Многие в этот период уже переосмыслили эти расходы ""на жильё"". Зачем жить в тесной каморке в дорогом городе (поближе к работе), если работать всё равно из дома?

Одна из причин того, почему Дублина и похожих городов это касается в куда меньшей степени - люди тут всё же часто платят не за близость к работе. Хороший район характеризуется приятным окружением, дружелюбными соседями, хорошими школами и т.п. Качество жизни. Да, в центре есть тесные каморки в старых домах, которых вообще не были предназначены чтобы там столько людей жило раньше, да и поновее строят компактно так. Но до абсурда дело не доходит, плотно, но бетонных ","You may have heard (including from me) that during the pandemic the demand for housing (at least removable) fell a little.Very insignificant.Prices for it did not fall in almost any way.With rare exceptions.And in some places have grown up.Another story with the purchase, there, I think, there was no close fall, since the planning horizon buying another horizon.

Many during this period have already rethought these expenses ""for housing"".Why live in a cramped closet in an expensive city (closer to work), if you work anyway from home?

One of the reasons why Dublin and similar cities applies to a much lesser extent - people here often pay not for proximity to work.A good area is characterized by a pleasant environment, friendly neighbors, good schools, etc.The quality of life.Yes, in the center there are close closers in old houses that were not intended at all so that so many people lived there earlier, and they are building more compactly like that.But it does not reach the point of absurdity, tightly, but concrete",heard including pandemic demand housing removable fell littleVery insignificantPrices fall wayWith rare exceptionsAnd place grown upAnother story purchase think close fall planning horizon buying horizon period rethought expense housingWhy live cramped closet expensive city closer work work home reason Dublin similar city applies lesser extent people pay proximity workA good area characterized pleasant environment friendly neighbor good school etcThe quality lifeYes center close closer old house intended people lived earlier building compactly thatBut reach point absurdity tightly concrete

Когда-то давно отпуск был чем-то, где я могла наконец выспаться. Потому что просыпаться в 7, чтобы дай бог добраться на работу к 9:30 — такое себе. День сурка, хмурые люди в метро, вот это всё изо дня в день — ну вы сами знаете наверное.

Но всё изменилось когда я переехала в Лимерик. Мой максимальный комьют на работу — полчаса пешком. С появлением велосипеда он уменьшился до 15 минут от двери квартиры до ноутбука в офисе. 

Свежий ветер и волосы назад > хмурые люди в метро

Раньше я была одержима своим фитбитом — сколько глубокого сна у меня было сегодня? О нет, меньше часа. Не дело, надо будет на выходных добрать.

Сейчас же я сплю каждый день около восьми часов, просыпаюсь сама (иногда с будильником) в 8:15-8:30, лечу на работу в хорошем настроении (ну то есть, пока карантин — и комьюта нет!), и даже по выходным просыпаюсь всё равно примерно в то же время и чувствую себя бодрой и отдохнувшей.

But everything changed when I moved to Limerick.My maximum comes to work - half an hour on foot.With the advent of the bicycle, it decreased to 15 minutes from the door of the apartment to the laptop in the office.

I used to be obsessed with my phytbit - how many deep sleep I had today?Oh no, less than an hour.It is not a matter, it will be necessary to get it on the weekend.

Now I’m sleeping about eight hours every day, I wake up myself (sometimes with an alarm clock) at 8: 15-8: 30, I fly to work in a good mood (that is, while quarantine is not!), And even on weekendsI wake up anyway at about the same time and feel cheerful and rested.

Это был тот ещё челлендж. Всего я сходила на пять показов, из них после четырех были мысли: ""боже мой, на фото это выглядело намного лучше"".

**Мой бюджет**
До €1000, желательно однушка, максимум двушка.

В Ирландии, так же, как и в ЮК, квартиры считаются по количеству спален. То есть, однушка – это одна спальня плюс гостиная, соединенная с кухней (в квартире выходит примерно 3-4 спальных места, в зависимости от размера дивана в гостиной, в 99% случаев он там есть).

**Проблемы, с которыми я столкнулась**
🏡 Однушки на рынке – это священные единороги. Все знают, что они есть, но никто никогда не видел
🏡 Те однушки, которые появлялись, были в моем бюджете (€600, €700, €975), но все, кроме последней, были в плохих (опасных) районах города и были ""убитые""
🏡 В однушках не бывает ванн, только душевые кабины. В редких двушках есть и то, и другое (да, обычно двушки с двумя ванными комнатами). Я очень хотела ванну, но ","[] (Https://telegra.ph/File/fff2cf169CE1B7A65DEFA.jpg) ** I found an apartment! **

It was still the Challenga.In total, I went to five shows, of them after four there were thoughts: ""My God, in the photo it looked much better.""

** My budget **
Up to € 1000, preferably odnushka, maximum kopecks.

In Ireland, as well as in the YUK, apartments are considered by the number of bedrooms.That is, odnushka is one bedroom plus the living room connected to the kitchen (about 3-4 sleeping places come out in the apartment, depending on the size of the sofa in the living room, in 99% of cases it is there).

** The problems that I have encountered **
🏡 odnushki in the market are sacred unicorns.Everyone knows that they are, but no one has ever seen

Точка на карте, где находится дом, немного меня спутала и мой потенциальный на тот момент лендлорд вызвался меня встретить. Пока его ждала, мимо проходила парочка лет 75+, они увидели, что я фоткаю всё подряд и завязали разговор.

Хотя если вы фолловите меня в [инстаграме](https://instagram.com/cee_aitch), то это не будет огромной новостью, переехали мы ещё в середине июля. 

Вот так в карантин кто-то разводится, а мы дважды съехались 😅 сначала 27 марта, когда государство закрылось на локдаун, и ввели правило 2км вокруг дома (а Даниэл жил тогда в 45км от меня, снимал комнату в доме), мы решили, что раз мы все равно оба работаем из дома и у нас получается изолироваться, то он переедет ко мне. Сделали тотальную перестановку моей ливингрум, она стала выполнять роль офиса (мы работали за одним столом), отдыхательной (с диваном и телеком) и кухня со столовой. Моя квартира конечно была хороша... для меня. Для двух людей, которые живут и работают дома, квартира оказалась тесновата. 

И вот в июне Даниэл предложил рассмотреть вариант переезда в какое-то другое место. Теперь уже по-настоящему: он выедет из своей комнаты ","[] (Https://telegra.ph/file/9d1951c05f196d39681cd.jpg) ** We moved!

Якщо ви придбали квартиру під час її будівництва за договором переуступки ще в Україні, а зараз переїхали до Ірландії, ми тут, щоб допомогти вам у процесі вступу у право власності на вашу квартиру. Ось що вам потрібно знати:

🔗 Розуміння угод про передачу прав:
Договір переуступки – це договір, за допомогою якого право вимоги на незавершене будівництво передається від однієї сторони до іншої. Умови Договору залишаються незмінними, забезпечуючи безперервність між початковим і новим покупцем.

🏠 Вступ у право власності з-за кордону:
Якщо ви, знаходячись в Ірландії, бажаєте оформити своє право власності на квартиру, один із способів зробити це – видати довіреність людині, якій ви довіряєте, в Україні. Ця особа представлятиме ваші інтереси та забезпечуватиме вжиття необхідних дій за вашої відсутності.

📜 Чим може допомогти довіреність","__ What may be in Ireland to enter the property of real estate that was purchased in Ukraine in a house that will be built in the future__?

If you purchased an apartment during its construction under the assignment agreement in Ukraine and now moved to Ireland, we are here to help you in the process of joining your apartment.That's what you need to know:

🔗 Understanding the transfer agreements:
The assignment agreement is a contract by which the right to require unfinished construction is transferred from one party to the other.The terms of the contract remain unchanged, ensuring the continuity between the elementary and new buyer.

🏠 Introduction to ownership from abroad:
If you, while in Ireland, want to apply for your own ownership of an apartment, one way to do it is to give a power of attorney to the person you trust in Ukraine.This person will represent your interests and will ensure the necessary actions in your absence.

Новий звіт «Моніторинг робочих місць» показує, що спокуса нижчих витрат на життя змушує багатьох шукати можливості за кордоном, у той час як наймання в деяких галузях почало скорочуватися.

❓**Карта irp - это ВНЖ в Ирландии?**

✅ Временная защита - это тоже ВНЖ. Ведь ВНЖ это не ПМЖ, разница огромная, хоть и созвучные аббревиатуры. Тут же важнее, что за тип ВНЖ. По сути, карточка ничего не меняет, она выдаётся всем резидентам для идентификации. А вот основания под выдачу могут быть разные: разрешение на работу, брак, учёба, и вот, временная защита для украинцев. Срок действия зависит от того, что именно выступало основанием для выдачи карты.

❓ **Если есть ВНЖ, то далее можно подаваться на ПМЖ?** Насколько я помню, примерно 1000 дней нужно жить в Ирландии перед тем, как подаваться на ПМЖ. Интересно, те, кто приехал в Ирландию в Марте 2022 года в марте 25 года могут оформлять ПМЖ?

❓ ** If there is a residence permit, then you can then be submitted to permanent residence? ** As far as I remember, about 1000 days you need to live in Ireland before being submitted for permanent residence.Interestingly, those who arrived in Ireland in March 2022 in March 25 can formalize permanent residence?

☄️Нова схема шахрайства набирає оберти все більше з кожним днем.

Схема така: люди шукають житло, деякі у відчаї, а містер Х пропонує людям житло за програмою apr, зазвичай з доплатою за комунальні, наприклад повна сума €1100, містер Х під натиском повідомлень (зазвичай це переписка) просить завдаток та плату за перший місяць і дає часу від одної доби до п'яти, в які люди мають на його рахунок вислати €2200, а далі все, містер Х зникає разом з €2200. 
За останні 2 тижні ми отримали купу таких скарг на шахраїв.

Про програму apr:
Кожен з нас (майже) знає, що таке програма apr - плата за визнання житла - це неоподатковуваний платіж у розмірі 800 євро на місяць за кожне помешкання, яке використовується для надання житла біженцям з України.

☄️The fraud scheme is gaining momentum every day.

The scheme is: people are looking for housing, some in despair, and Mr. X offers people housing under the APR program, usually with a surcharge for municipal, such as the full amount of € 1100, Mr. X under pressure from messages (usually a correspondence) asks for a deposit and fee for the first monthAnd it gives time from one day to five, in which people have to send € 2200, and then Mr. X disappears with € 2,200.
In the last 2 weeks we have received a lot of such complaints about fraudsters.

About APR program:
Each of us (almost) knows what the APR program is - a fee for housing is a non -taxable payment of 800 euros per month for each dwelling used for giving housing to refugees from Ukraine.Housing should be provided at a minimum of 6 months and meet the required standards, more at https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recogniti",fraudstersBe careful fraud scheme gaining momentum day scheme people looking housing despair Mr X offer people housing APR program usually surcharge municipal 1100 Mr X pressure message usually correspondence asks deposit fee monthAnd give time day people send 2200 Mr X disappears 2200 2 week received lot complaint fraudsters APR program know APR program fee housing non taxable payment 800 euro month dwelling giving housing refugee UkraineHousing provided minimum 6 month meet required standard

Про додаткове фінансування [оголосили міністр](https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/extra-billion-euro-diverted-to-help-accommodate-ukrainian-refugees-1531385.html) інтеграції Родерік О’Горман і міністр державних витрат Паскаль Донохью.  

☝ Країна допомагає оплачувати житло понад 70 000 українців. Щотижня до Ірландії прибувають в середньому 550 людей, тому до кінця зими невелику кількість переселенців будуть розміщувати у наметах.  

✅ Виділений бюджет допоможе державі покрити витрати на прихисток українців та інших людей, які шукають міжнародного захисту. 

Донохью зазначив, що країні довелося надзвичайно багато працювати, щоб впоратися зі значним потоком людей з України після початку повномасштабного вторгнення рф.

Несколько лет назад мой друг Антон позвал меня съездить в Ирландию на фестиваль в Керри, который называется scoil cheoil an earraigh, с ирландского это переводится как “Весенняя школа музыки”. Я была весьма удивлена такому названию, потому что фестиваль проходил во второй половине февраля, что совершенно не укладывается в голове у человека, живущего в Москве. Я впервые попала в Ирландию в сезон, когда в России полным ходом была зима. И меня ждал сюрприз - название фестиваля вполне соответствовало окружающей обстановке. В Ирландии в феврале, как и летом, все вокруг зеленое, а еще начинают цвести магнолии и поют птички.

Если обратиться к ирландскому фольклору, 1 февраля в Ирландии празднуют Имболк или день святой Бригитты. Это такая же важная фигура, как святой Патрик. Святая Бригитта покровительница поэзии, обучения, целительства, защиты, кузнечного дела, животноводства и молочного скотоводства.

Жоден український біженець не буде відправлений додому, доки не закінчиться війна Росії, заявив taoiseach Лео Варадкар.
Варадкар також очікує, що ЄС продовжить статус тимчасового захисту, який пропонують біженцям, які тікають від війни в Україні.

Директива про тимчасовий захист дозволяє українським біженцям отримувати житло та соціальне забезпечення в ЄС, і її вже подовжено. Термін дії директиви закінчується 4 березня 2025 року. Незважаючи на те, що директива не може бути продовжена знову, ЄС може прийняти рішення про нові положення для українських біженців.

Однак Варадкар сказав, що жодних біженців не повернуть в Україну з Ірландії, поки триває війна.

«Чесно кажучи, я не можу уявити, що ми зможемо зробити це, поки війна не закінчиться», — сказав він.

No Ukrainian refugee will be sent home until the war of Russia, Taoiseach Leo Varadar said.

The Provisional Protection Directive allows Ukrainian refugees to receive housing and social security in the EU, and has already been extended.The directive expires on March 4, 2025.Despite the fact that the directive cannot be continued again, the EU may decide on new provisions for Ukrainian refugees.

Орієнтування на ринку нерухомості в Ірландії може бути складною справою. Наші юристи з rostra solicitors, готові надати вам повну інформацію щодо цього питання.

📜 Що таке гербовий збір?
Гербовий збір (stamp duty)  - це податок, який ви сплачуєте при передачі права власності. Це стосується правовстановлюючих документів, які передають право власності на землю та будівлі, як житлові, так і нежитлові. Якщо ви купуєте будинок, квартиру чи земельну ділянку з дозвілом на будівництво, стягується гербовий збір. Ось короткий огляд:

🏡 Житлова нерухомість - включає будинки, квартири та ділянки з дозволом на будівництво житлової нерухомості.

🏢 Нежитлова нерухомість - охоплює землю або житлові ділянки без житлових будинків, як правило, для комерційного використання.

Основним фактором, що впливає на гербовий збір, є вартість майна. Вища ставка застосовується, якщо ви купуєте 10 або більше житлових будинків або дуплексів одночасно або протягом року, щоб переш","🏠 Mernetic gathering for property in Ireland 🏠

🏡 Residential real estate - includes houses, apartments and areas with a residence permit.

Кількість доступного житла в Ірландії зараз дуже обмежена. Тому українським біженцям доводиться зупинятися там, де на момент прибуття доступне житло. Українців розміщують у номері готелю або в школах і великих спортивних залах з перспективою поступового розселення в номери, що звільнилися.

Ціни на оренду житла у країні досить високі. Окрема кімната у комунальній квартирі коштуватиме приблизно 950 євро на місяць, будинок у маленькому місті – 1500 євро, а у столиці – близько 2500 євро на місяць. Також слід розраховувати на оплату комунальних послуг – від 100 євро на місяць.

Наша группа скорее взаимопомощь от украинцев украинцам, бежавших от войны, советы, опыт, интересная информация, но с жильём тут не помогут. Наша группа открытая (во всяком случае пока 😉) и вы также можете столкнуться с хейтом от ботов и недовольных беженцами людей. Тем не менее, не теряйте надежды и веры в свои силы.

Но вот, наконец-то, дело сдвинулось с мёртвой точки, так что попробую рассказать что и как.

Искать дом через daft.ie я начала ещё с осени 2022 года. У меня был выбран набор определенных фильтров, новые объявления по которым приходили мне на почту.

Я каждый вечер смотрела новые дома, но все было прям не очень. То, что было очень, стоило слишком дорого для нас.

В феврале мы уезжали в Мексику в отпуск, накануне отъезда я смотрела новые уведомления и увидела дом с ручьём в горах. Это было второе объявление после «домика принцессы», по которому я была готова прямо сейчас ехать на просмотры. Но в тот м","🏡 ** And what about the house?

Це стосується житла, яке приватні власники виставили на продаж. Це дозволить орендарям продовжувати орендувати цю нерухомість у Агентства.

Щоб уникнути ризику програма поширюється на приватних орендарів, договори з якими були розірвані згідно із законом, тому що орендодавець вирішив продати власність. Отже, приватні орендарі ризикують стати бездомними.

Не помню, рассказывала я тут уже или нет, но много лет назад я открыла для себя cat sitting. Когда я ещё училась в универе, это была работа по бартеру - я присматривала за животными, и за это могла жить в квартире хозяев. 

Когда мы переехали в Ирландию, проблем с жильём уже не было, но cat sittings стал одной из моих подработок - за уход за животным я получала деньги. [Я зарегистрировалась в сервисе cat in a flat](https://catinaflat.ie/pet-sitter/367014), и спустя пару месяцев получила свой первый заказ.

Одна из кошек, которые у меня были, мне ужасно не нравилась. Она вечно пряталась под диваном, шипела на меня, разбрасывала наполнитель по всему полу вокруг лотка, проливала воду вокруг кормушки. Лишь пару раз она вылезала из-под дивана и недовольно требовала ее почесать. В конце присмотра за ней я подумала, что вряд ли меня позовут ещё раз, я явн","🐈‍⬛ ** About Cat Sitting and loss **

I don’t remember whether I already told me or not, but many years ago I discovered Cat Sitting for myself.When I was still studying at the university, it was a work on Barter - I looked after animals, and for this I could live in the owners' apartment.

За інформацією irish independent, публікація тендерного запиту відбудеться не раніше кінця літа - початку осені. Точні деталі, де саме будуть пришвартовані ""флотелі"", ще не визначені. У цьому процесі бере участь морський підрозділ Міністерства транспорту.

✅ **Заповніть вже нарешті форму** (якщо не купувати лотерейний білет –  не виграти у лотерею);
✅ **Опишіть кожен пункт максимально деталізовано** (це ваша інвестиція у швидке переселення);
✅ **Не зосереджуйтесь тільки на містах** (поруч із містом знайти варіант значно швидше. Так, ми знаємо про проблеми із транспортом);
✅ **Чим більш гнучкий ваш запит – тим швидше буде знайдено житло** (Наприклад: так, ми згодні на 15-40км у радіусі від Леттеркенні);
✅ **Вказуйте точні адреси де ви працюєте, або навчаються ваші діти** (шанс отримати житло поруч із роботою/школою);
✅ **Після заповнення форми будьте на зв’язку** (були випадки, коли житло хотіли відміняти, бо не мали змоги зв’язатися із власником заяви);
✅ **Не вимагайте джакузі, басейн або «із видом на океан» **(це реально не жарт – ми пишаємось, що поруч є такі люди);

❗️Пам’ята","🤞 ** As promised, lifehacks, how to speed up your resettlement!We understand that the queue on Pledged Accommodation is big but there are simple steps like accelerating it: ** 🤞 🤞

 ** Finish the form ** (if you do not buy a lottery ticket - do not win the lottery);
✅ ** Describe each item as detailed as possible ** (this is your investment in rapid relocation);
 ** Do not focus only in cities ** (near the city find the option much faster. Yes, we know about transport problems);
 ** The more flexible your request, the faster the housing will be found ** (for example: yes, we agree to 15-40km within letters of letters);
 ** Specify the exact addresses where you work or study your children ** (a chance to get housing next to work/school);
 ** After filling in the form, be in touch ** (there were cases when housing wanted to be abolished because they were unable to contact the application owner);
✅ ** Do not demand jacuzzi, swimming pool or ""overlooking on the ocean"" ** (this is not really a joke - we are proud of that there are such people nearby);

**](https://virlandii.ie/2023/06/ministry-irlandii-svariatsia/)Останнім часом з’явилися повідомлення про напруженість у Кабінеті міністрів Ірландії через розміщення новоприбулих біженців, зокрема, біженців з України. Особлива увага прикута до «зіткнень» міністра житлового будівництва Даррага О’Браєна та міністра інтеграції Родеріка О’Гормана. Мовляв, обидва міністри посварилися просто на засіданні Кабінету міністрів.

Тоді слухалося питання врегулювання кризи розміщення новоприбулих. Пан О’Горман сказав колегам, що всі вони повинні зробити більше. Саме після цих його слів, підмітили журналісти, начебто й виникла напруга у стосунках з міністром житлового будівництва. Однак Дарраг О’Браєн різко відреагував на подібні повідомлення...
